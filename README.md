# Vanilla Javascript Weather App
The Weather App has a search engine and uses API integration with
https://openweathermap.org/ to show the current weather. The app
shows the current temperature in Celsius with the option to convert to
the current temperature in Fahrenheit for the searched city. A
description and weather icon is provided for the current weather.
A forecast is shown for the searched city for six days with a high
and low temperature in Celsius and a weather icon for each
day. Background image from https://unsplash.com/ Illustrations
